    I know words. I have the best words. Trump Ipsum is calling for a total and
    complete shutdown of Muslim text entering your website. My text is long and
    beautiful, as, it has been well documented, are various other parts of my
    website. I'm speaking with myself, number one, because I have a very good
    brain and I've said a lot of things.
